For various reasons Gauda Saraswat Brahmins migrated from Goa, their ancestral land for centuries, and settled in the location of Karkala. 
They erected a small temple, enshrined Lord Shree Venkataramana in it and worshiped him for the betterment of their religious, cultural and social welfare.</p>
